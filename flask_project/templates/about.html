<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>Paleography is the study of ancient scripts and handwriting.</p>
<p>It is important for understanding, authenticating, and dating ancient texts, as the shapes of letters depend of the time and place the manuscripts were written.</p>
<p>This project aims to recognize Ashkenazi Hebrew script among different Hebrew script types.</p>
